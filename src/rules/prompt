Design a modern, professional SaaS dashboard interface with a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly from desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The dashboard should include a collapsible / toggleable sidebar navigation:

On desktop: sidebar expanded by default with icons and labels

On tablet: sidebar collapsed to icons only, expandable on tap

On mobile: sidebar hidden by default and opens as an off-canvas drawer when the hamburger menu is tapped

Layout Requirements:

Top navigation bar with page title, search field, notification icon, and user profile menu

Left sidebar containing primary navigation items (Dashboard, Analytics, Appointments, Patients, Billing, Settings) with icons

Main content area displaying cards, charts, tables, and KPIs

Cards should stack vertically on mobile and align in a grid on larger screens

Design Style:

Clean, minimal, and modern UI

Soft shadows, rounded corners (8–12px)

Neutral background with subtle accent color for highlights and active states

Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography

UX Considerations:

Smooth sidebar toggle animation

Touch-friendly buttons and spacing on mobile

Sticky top bar for easy navigation

Consistent spacing and alignment across breakpoints

Accessibility:

High contrast text

Large tap targets on mobile

Clear focus and hover states

Overall, the dashboard should feel fast, intuitive, and scalable, suitable for a professional SaaS or management system.
